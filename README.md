# progset 2

Goal: Implementing Strassen's algorithm optimizing, for practical usecases by determining a cross over to normal matrix multiplication. 

TODO: 
- Use math for initial cross-over estimate
- Figure out representation for matrices
- Implement basic matrix multiplication 
- Implement Strassen's algorithm
- Experiment to find true cross-over 
-
